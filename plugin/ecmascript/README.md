# ECMAScript Plugin

The **ECMAScript Plugin** adds support for the **JavaScript** and **TypeScript** languages within the system. This
allows nodes to utilize JavaScript/TypeScript syntax to perform flexible and powerful data processing and logic
execution.

## Supported Languages

- **[JavaScript](https://www.ecma-international.org/publications-and-standards/standards/ecma-262)**: One of the most
  widely used scripting languages, providing powerful capabilities for both web and server-side development.
- **[TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)**: A strongly typed superset of JavaScript that enables safer and more
  robust code through its advanced type system.
