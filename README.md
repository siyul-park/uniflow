**A high-performance, extremely flexible, and easily extensible multipurpose workflow engine.**

## üìù Overview

**Uniflow** excels at managing tasks of varying durations, offering an environment where data processing flows can be defined declaratively and modified dynamically. With [built-in extensions](./ext/README.md), it executes tasks efficiently, allowing you to freely add or remove nodes as needed.

Deliver a personalized experience for your service and expand functionality without limits.

## üéØ Core Values

- **Performance:** Achieve maximum throughput and minimal latency across diverse environments.
- **Flexibility:** Dynamically modify specifications and make real-time adjustments.
- **Scalability:** Seamlessly add new nodes to enhance functionality.

## üöÄ Getting Started

### üõ†Ô∏è Build and Install

**[Go 1.22](https://go.dev/doc/install)** or later is required. Follow these steps to build the code:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/siyul-park/uniflow

cd uniflow

make init
make build
```

Upon completion, the executable will be located in the `dist` folder.

### ‚ö° Example Run

Let's run a simple HTTP request example using [ping.yaml](./examples/ping.yaml):

```yaml
- kind: listener
  name: listener
  protocol: http
  port: 8000
  links:
    out:
      - name: router
        port: in

- kind: router
  name: router
  routes:
    - method: GET
      path: /ping
      port: out[0]
  links:
    out[0]:
      - name: pong
        port: in

- kind: snippet
  name: pong
  language: text
  code: pong
```

To execute the workflow, use the following command:

```sh
uniflow start --filename example/ping.yaml
```

Verify it works by calling the HTTP endpoint:

```sh
curl localhost:8000/ping
pong#
```

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

Environment settings can be configured via the `.uniflow.toml` file or system environment variables.

| TOML Key            | Environment Variable Key | Example                    |
|---------------------|--------------------------|----------------------------|
| `database.url`      | `DATABASE.URL`           | `mem://` or `mongodb://`   |
| `database.name`     | `DATABASE.NAME`          | -                          |
| `collection.nodes`  | `COLLECTION.NODES`       | `nodes`                    |

## üìä Benchmark

Benchmark results performed on **[Contabo](https://contabo.com/)**'s VPS S SSD (4 cores, 8GB). The [Apache HTTP server benchmarking tool](https://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.4/programs/ab.html) was used to measure the [ping.yaml](./examples/ping.yaml) workflow consisting of `listener`, `router`, and `snippet` nodes.

```sh
ab -n 102400 -c 1024 http://127.0.0.1:8000/ping
```
