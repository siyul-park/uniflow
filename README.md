**A high-performance, extremely flexible, and easily extensible universal workflow engine.**

## üìù Overview

**Uniflow** is designed to manage a wide range of tasks, from short-term jobs to long-term processes. It supports declarative workflow definitions and allows for dynamic changes to data flows. With [built-in extensions](./ext/README.md), you can implement complex workflows and add or remove nodes to expand its functionality as needed.

This system empowers you to deliver customized experiences through your service and continuously enhance its capabilities.

## üéØ Core Values

- **Performance:** Optimized for maximum throughput and minimal latency.
- **Flexibility:** Adapt workflows on-the-fly to meet evolving needs.
- **Extensibility:** Easily integrate new components and expand your system‚Äôs functionality.

## üöÄ Quick Start

### üõ†Ô∏è Build and Install

To get started, install **[Go 1.23](https://go.dev/doc/install)** or later. Then, follow these steps:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/siyul-park/uniflow

cd uniflow

make init
make build
```

The executable will be located in the `dist` directory after building.

### ‚ö° Run an Example

Try a basic HTTP request handler using [ping.yaml](./examples/ping.yaml):

```yaml
- kind: listener
  name: listener
  protocol: http
  port: '{{ .PORT }}'
  env:
    PORT:
      data: '{{ .PORT }}'
  ports:
    out:
      - name: router
        port: in

- kind: router
  name: router
  routes:
    - method: GET
      path: /ping
      port: out[0]
  ports:
    out[0]:
      - name: pong
        port: in

- kind: snippet
  name: pong
  language: text
  code: pong
```

Start the workflow with:

```sh
./dist/uniflow start --from-specs ./examples/ping.yaml --env PORT=8000
```

Verify by calling the HTTP endpoint:

```sh
curl localhost:8000/ping
pong#
```

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

Adjust settings through `.uniflow.toml` or environment variables.

| TOML Key            | Environment Variable Key | Example                  |
|---------------------|--------------------------|--------------------------|
| `database.url`      | `DATABASE_URL`           | `mem://` or `mongodb://` |
| `database.name`     | `DATABASE_NAME`          | -                        |
| `collection.specs`  | `COLLECTION_SPECS`       | `specs`                  |
| `collection.values` | `COLLECTION_VALUES`      | `values`                 |

## üìä Benchmark

The following benchmark was conducted on a **[Contabo](https://contabo.com/)** VPS S SSD (4 cores, 8GB) using the [Apache HTTP benchmarking tool](https://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.4/programs/ab.html) to measure the performance of [ping.yaml](./examples/ping.yaml) involving `listener`, `router`, and `snippet` nodes.

```sh
ab -n 102400 -c 1024 http://127.0.0.1:8000/ping
```
