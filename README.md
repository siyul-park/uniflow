**A high-performance, extremely flexible, and easily extensible universal workflow engine.**

## üìù Overview

Efficiently manage complex data flows and adjust them in real-time. With the ability to add [plugins](plugins/README.md), workflows can be easily expanded to optimize processes according to business needs. Build a strong foundation for continuous system evolution and deliver personalized services.

## üéØ Key Features

- **Performance:** Offers maximum throughput and minimal latency across various environments.
- **Flexibility:** Adjust and modify workflows in real-time.
- **Scalability:** Easily expand functionality by adding new components.

## üöÄ Quick Start

### üõ†Ô∏è Build and Installation

To build the source code, ensure you have **[Go 1.24 or above](https://go.dev/doc/install)** installed and run the
following commands:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/siyul-park/uniflow

cd uniflow

make init
make build-all
```

After building, the executable will be created in the `dist` directory.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

You can manage configuration using environment variables or a `.uniflow.toml` file. Here's an example of registering and
configuring the built-in plugins:

```toml
[runtime]
namespace = "default"
language = "cel"

[database]
url = "memory://"

[collection]
specs = "specs"
values = "values"

[[plugins]]
path = "./dist/cel.so"
config.extensions = ["encoders", "math", "lists", "sets", "strings"]

[[plugins]]
path = "./dist/ecmascript.so"

[[plugins]]
path = "./dist/mongodb.so"

[[plugins]]
path = "./dist/reflect.so"

[[plugins]]
path = "./dist/ctrl.so"

[[plugins]]
path = "./dist/net.so"

[[plugins]]
path = "./dist/sql.so"

[[plugins]]
path = "./dist/testing.so"
```

### ‚ö° Example Run

To run the [ping.yaml](examples/ping.yaml) example, which processes HTTP requests, use the following configuration:

```yaml
- kind: listener
  name: listener
  protocol: http
  port: '{{ .PORT }}'
  env:
    PORT:
      data: '{{ .PORT }}'
  ports:
    out:
      - name: router
        port: in

- kind: router
  name: router
  routes:
    - method: GET
      path: /ping
      port: out[0]
  ports:
    out[0]:
      - name: pong
        port: in

- kind: snippet
  name: pong
  language: text
  code: pong
```

Start the workflow with this command:

```sh
./dist/uniflow start --from-specs ./examples/ping.yaml --environment PORT=8000
```

To verify it's working, use the following command to call the HTTP endpoint:

```sh
curl localhost:8000/ping
pong#
```

## üìä Benchmark

The following benchmark was run on a **[Contabo](https://contabo.com/)** VPS S SSD (4-core, 8GB) environment.  
The test was conducted using
the [Apache HTTP server benchmarking tool](https://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.4/programs/ab.html) on a workflow consisting
of `listener`, `router`, and `snippet` nodes, using the [ping.yaml](examples/ping.yaml) example.

```sh
ab -n 102400 -c 1024 http://127.0.0.1:8000/ping
```
