**A high-performance, extremely flexible, and easily extensible universal workflow engine.**

## üìù Overview

**Uniflow** efficiently handles a wide range of tasks from short-term jobs to long-term processes. It allows for declarative definition and dynamic modification of data flows, leveraging [built-in extension capabilities](./ext/README.md) to easily implement complex workflows. Moreover, it offers flexibility to expand functionality by adding new nodes or removing existing ones as needed.

Provide a personalized experience through your service and consistently expand its capabilities.

## üéØ Core Values

- **Performance:** Achieve optimal throughput and minimal latency across various environments.
- **Flexibility:** Dynamically modify and adjust workflows in real-time.
- **Extensibility:** Extend system functionality through new components.

## üöÄ Quick Start

### üõ†Ô∏è Build and Install

**[Go 1.22](https://go.dev/doc/install)** or higher is required. Follow these steps to build from source:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/siyul-park/uniflow

cd uniflow

make init
make build
```

After building, the executable will be located in the `dist` directory.

### ‚ö° Run an Example

Let's run a basic HTTP request handling example, [ping.yaml](./examples/ping.yaml):

```yaml
- kind: listener
  name: listener
  protocol: http
  port: 8000
  ports:
    out:
      - name: router
        port: in

- kind: router
  name: router
  routes:
    - method: GET
      path: /ping
      port: out[0]
  ports:
    out[0]:
      - name: pong
        port: in

- kind: snippet
  name: pong
  language: text
  code: pong
```

To run the workflow, use the following command:

```sh
uniflow start --filename example/ping.yaml
```

To verify it's working, call the HTTP endpoint:

```sh
curl localhost:8000/ping
pong#
```

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

You can configure settings through the `.uniflow.toml` file or system environment variables.

| TOML Key           | Environment Variable | Example                   |
|--------------------|----------------------|---------------------------|
| `database.url`     | `DATABASE.URL`       | `mem://` or `mongodb://`  |
| `database.name`    | `DATABASE.NAME`      | -                         |
| `collection.nodes` | `COLLECTION.NODES`   | `nodes`                   |

## üìä Benchmark

Below are benchmark results performed on a **[Contabo](https://contabo.com/)** VPS S SSD (4 cores, 8GB) environment. We used the [Apache HTTP server benchmarking tool](https://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.4/programs/ab.html) to measure the [ping.yaml](./examples/ping.yaml) workflow consisting of `listener`, `router`, and `snippet` nodes.

```sh
ab -n 102400 -c 1024 http://127.0.0.1:8000/ping
```
