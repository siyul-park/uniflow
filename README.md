**A high-performance, extremely flexible, and easily extensible universal workflow engine.**

## üìù Overview

**Uniflow** is designed to manage a wide range of tasks, from short-term jobs to long-term processes. It supports declarative workflow definitions and allows for dynamic changes to data flows. With [built-in extensions](./ext/README.md), you can implement complex workflows and add or remove nodes to expand its functionality as needed.

This system empowers you to deliver customized experiences through your service and continuously enhance its capabilities.

## üéØ Core Values

- **Performance:** Maximize throughput and minimize latency across various environments.
- **Flexibility:** Modify and adjust workflows in real-time.
- **Extensibility:** Easily extend functionality with new components.

## üöÄ Quick Start

### üõ†Ô∏è Build and Install

To begin, install **[Go 1.23](https://go.dev/doc/install)** or later. Then, follow these steps to build the source code:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/siyul-park/uniflow

cd uniflow

make init
make build
```

The executable will be located in the `dist` directory after building.

### ‚ö° Running an Example

To run a basic HTTP request handler example using [ping.yaml](./examples/ping.yaml):

```yaml
- kind: listener
  name: listener
  protocol: http
  port: '{{ .PORT }}'
  ports:
    out:
      - name: router
        port: in
  env:
    PORT:
      data: '{{ .PORT }}'

- kind: router
  name: router
  routes:
    - method: GET
      path: /ping
      port: out[0]
  ports:
    out[0]:
      - name: pong
        port: in

- kind: snippet
  name: pong
  language: text
  code: pong
```

To start the workflow, run:

```sh
./dist/uniflow start --from-specs ./examples/ping.yaml --env=PORT=8000
```

Verify it's running by calling the HTTP endpoint:

```sh
curl localhost:8000/ping
pong#
```

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

Settings can be adjusted via the `.uniflow.toml` file or environment variables.

| TOML Key             | Environment Variable Key | Example                   |
|----------------------|--------------------------|---------------------------|
| `database.url`       | `DATABASE.URL`           | `mem://` or `mongodb://`   |
| `database.name`      | `DATABASE.NAME`          | -                         |
| `collection.nodes`   | `COLLECTION.NODES`       | `nodes`                   |
| `collection.secrets` | `COLLECTION.SECRETS`     | `secrets`                 |

## üìä Benchmark

The benchmark below was conducted on a **[Contabo](https://contabo.com/)** VPS S SSD (4 cores, 8GB) using the [Apache HTTP benchmarking tool](https://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.4/programs/ab.html). It measures the performance of the [ping.yaml](./examples/ping.yaml) workflow, including `listener`, `router`, and `snippet` nodes.

```sh
ab -n 102400 -c 1024 http://127.0.0.1:8000/ping
```
